```notes checkout:react-local-state/1
Before we start coding, let's get familiar with
the code that Matt -our awesome product designer-
has prepared for us. Here we have the root
component, which has two main sections:

- The Orders component
- And the Currencies

and then, here in the middle: we have a button
for adding orders and these OrderTotal component
which renders the total sum of the
base-currency-price of the orders.

Perfect! Now, let's have a quick look at
the Orders and the Currencies
```

```jsx 86:97 file="./codeblocks/react/01_startingpoint.tsx" subtitle="Starting point"
App;
```

```notes
The Orders component is just a Table that
renders the different Orders, using the
OrdersLine Component.

Also, we notice that the initial orders are
currently hardcoded and they com from the
initialOrders which is imported from the utils
file.
```

```diff 70:78
  Orders
```

```notes
The Orderline component: very straightforward.
It gets an Order through props and it renders
its properties.
Its worth noting, though, that the base-cc-price,
which is a computed field, is currenctly hardcoded.
```

```diff 55:68
  Orderline
```

```notes
The Currencies Component is alost identical
to the Orders component: just a table with
different columns and it renders a CurrencyRate
row for each currency.

Like with the orders, the currencies are
currently being hardcoded from the
`initialCurrencyRates` also come from the utils file.
```

```diff 23:32
  Currencies
```

```notes
The CurrencyRate component: this is the one 
that it's used for editting the currencies
and it's also very straightforward:

It renders a currency, and it's rate value,
which can be editted through the NumberInput
component.

Awesome! Now let's start coding!
