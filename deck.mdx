```notes checkout:react-local-state/1
Before we start coding, let's get familiar with
the code that Matt -our awesome product designer-
has prepared for us. Here we have the root
component, which has two main sections:

- The Orders component
- And the Currencies

and then, here in the middle: we have a button
for adding orders and these OrderTotal component
which renders the total sum of the
base-currency-price of the orders.

Perfect! Now, let's have a quick look at
the Orders and the Currencies
```

```jsx 86:97 file="./codeblocks/react/01_startingpoint.tsx"
App;
```

```notes
The Orders component is just a Table that
renders the different Orders, using the
OrdersLine Component.

Also, we notice that the initial orders are
currently hardcoded and they com from the
initialOrders which is imported from the utils
file.
```

```diff 70:78
  Orders
```

```notes
The Orderline component: very straightforward.
It gets an Order through props and it renders
its properties.
Its worth noting, though, that the base-cc-price,
which is a computed field, is currenctly hardcoded.
```

```diff 55:68
  Orderline
```

```notes
The Currencies Component is almost identical
to the Orders component: just a table with
different columns and it renders a CurrencyRate
row for each currency.

Like with the orders, the currencies are
currently being hardcoded from the
`initialCurrencyRates` also come from the
utils file.
```

```diff 23:32
  Currencies
```

```notes
The CurrencyRate component: this is the one 
that it's used for editting the currencies
and it's also very straightforward:

It renders a currency, and it's rate value,
which can be editted through the NumberInput
component.

Awesome! Now let's start coding!
```

```diff 11:21
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/2
We have noticed that the currencies are
being used in the 2 main components. So,
this is data that needs to be accessed by
different components at different levels,
let's put use React Context to have them
easily available.

We create a hook to easily access the
currencies, and a CurrenciesProvider that
we will use in our root component.
```

```jsx 12:23 file="./codeblocks/react/02_1currencyContext.tsx"
```

```notes
Let's use the `useCurrencies` hook.
```

```diff 37:46
```

```jsx 37:46 file="./codeblocks/react/02_2currencyContext.tsx"
```

```notes
Again...
```

```diff 48:67
```

```jsx 48:67 file="./codeblocks/react/02_3currencyContext.tsx"
```

```notes
And let's use the CurrenciesProvider
in our root component.

Ok, that wasn't too hard!
```

```diff 100:111
```

```jsx 101,112 file="./codeblocks/react/02_4currencyContext.tsx"
```

```notes
Now lets wire up the
Exchanges Rate section
```

```diff 25:35
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/3
Easy! Let's keep it simple,
using `useState` should do.

I mean, we shouldn't be lifting
state unless we have to, right?

Look at that! This is working just great,
and without any annoying re-renders
on the components that are not concerned
with the currency that we just updated.

Now  that we are done with
the Exchanges Rate section
let's move on to the Orders
section.
```

```jsx 26,31 file="./codeblocks/react/03_exchangeRate.tsx"
```

```notes
Let's start by wiring up the price
and currency selection of each
order.
```

```diff 69:82
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/4
And again, a couple of `useState`
here and that's it!

Now let's make sure that this is
working correctly...

Amazing! Look at that: we got ~75% of
the functionality working already.

Ok, now let's wire up the
base-currency-price...

Oh, wait! shut! Mmmm... To calculate
this value we have to access the rate
of the selected currency.

All right, that's ok, we just need to lift
the state of the currency-rates, right?
No big deal... Let's do it.
```

```jsx file="./codeblocks/react/04_orderLinePrice.tsx"
```

```notes
We create another Context for the
currencyRates.
```

```diff 12:23
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/5
then we create a useCurencyRates hook
to easily access the state of the
currencyRates and a ContextProvider
that we can place in the already
existing Currencies Provider.
```

```jsx 19:23,29,31 file="./codeblocks/react/05_1liftCurrencyRates.tsx"
```

```notes
then we replace the useState with
our `useCurrencyRatesHook` and...
we are done!

Lifting state it's a bit of a pain,
but it's not so bad, right?

Ok, let's make sure that the
currency rates are still working...

Ok, so, they do work, but wait...
Oh, cmon, now every single row re-renders?

Oh, of course, because now every time
that a currency-rate changes the whole
record changes and that triggers
a re-render per each row... Dang!

Ok, there are a number of ways
that we can use to prevent these
re-renders... But I guess that the
simplest in this case is to let
the parent component pass
everything down to the CurrencyRate
component and then use the memo
HOC to prevent the CurrencyRate
component from re-rendering.

All right, all right, let's do
that...
```

```diff 36:46
```

```jsx 37:38,45:47 file="./codeblocks/react/05_2liftCurrencyRates.tsx"
```

```diff 36:63
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/7
Now the Currencies component
is the one passing down everything
that the CurrencyRate component
needs, and then we ehance
the CurrencyRate component
with `memo` to prevent
re-renders
```

```jsx 36:40,57,60:66 file="./codeblocks/react/06_avoidRerenders.tsx"
```

```notes
We are finally ready
to wire-up the base-ccy-price.
```

```diff 93:108
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/8
We obtain the currencyRates
from context and then we
can calculate the baseCurrencyPrice
using the getBaseCurrencyPrice
function that's defined in
the utils file.

Let's try it:

Nice, it's working...

Although every time that
we change a currency rate
every single order
re-renders, even when
we change a currency rate
that's not being used...

Of course, because we
are accessing the currencyRates
from the Orderline component
and now every time that
one of the currencies
changes that triggers
a re-render in every
Order...

We could prevent that
if the Orderline Component
received through props
the rate that its relevant
to them. However, in order
to know that, we need to
be able to access from
the outside the selected
currency... So, we should
also lift the state of
the selected currency.

Actually, we will have
to do that anyways, because
I just noticed that we will
need to access the state
of the base-ccy-price from
the outside to compute
the sum...

So, let's lift this state.
```

```jsx 97:98,108 file="./codeblocks/react/07_orderLinePrice.tsx"
```

```notes
Let's add a new context for
the orders, but before we
do that, we will first
create a reducer for
the Orders, because now
it's state is a bit more
complex than just setting
a property. Also, this
will help us to prevent
re-renders, because we
will be able to pass
the `dispatch` down
without createing new
functions.
```

```diff 15:55
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/9
The reducer is a bit
verbose, but it makes
things easier for the
consumer of dispatch.
```

```jsx 44:80 file="./codeblocks/react/08_1liftOrdersState.tsx"
```

```notes
Now we can create the context
for the orders... As usual
we create a hook for accessing
the orders from context
and a Provider that
we will place in our
root component.
```

```jsx 82:93 file="./codeblocks/react/08_2liftOrdersState.tsx"
```

```notes
Now lets change the Orders
component so that it
accesses the currencies
and the orders from
context and it spoon-feeds
the Orderline Component
```

```diff 171:180
```

```notes
That's it...
```

```jsx 172:173,177:182 file="./codeblocks/react/08_3liftOrdersState.tsx"
```

```notes
And time to make the
Orderline component a lot
dummer.
```

```diff 152:169
```

```notes
Now the Orderline component
receives everythng from props
and the onChange handlers
are a bit more verbose than
before, but that's ok.
```

```jsx 152:156,164:166,172:174 file="./codeblocks/react/08_4liftOrdersState.tsx"
```

```notes
And let's not forget to add
the OrdersProvider
```

```diff 204:217
```

```notes
Alright, now that we've
lifted the state, let's
make sure that we don't have
unwanted re-renders.

Nice!

Now we are finally ready
to make the Add button and
the OrderTotal component
work.
```

```jsx 206,217 file="./codeblocks/react/08_5liftOrdersState.tsx"
```

```notes
Let's start with the Add
button. Ok, so we better
create a component for this
button... Otherwise we
will be triggering re-renders
everywhere every time that
one of the orders change...

I guess that we could have
split the context of the orders
to separate the dispatch from
the state... Maybe next time!
```

```diff 211
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/10
So, here we have the new
component accessing the
dispatch for creating a new row.

Let's see if it works...

Awesome!
```

```jsx 201:212,226 file="./codeblocks/react/09_addOrderButton.tsx"

```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/11
Almost done! Let's wire
this one up, and that's it...
```

```diff 214:217
```

```notes
So, we access the orders
and the currencyRates and
we map each order to calculate
its base-ccy-price and then
we add them all together
and we are done!

It bothers me a bit that
I have to recalculate the
base-ccy-price per each
order, because we have already
done this in the Orderline
component...

But, how else are we going
to do this using React as
a state-management library?

Create a common reducer
between the currencies and
the orders? So that we can
update the base-ccy-price
every time that one of
them change? That would
be pretty bad...

Should we use a library
like reselect for memoizing
these computations? That
wouldn't work either
because each Order
is a different computation.

Anyways, this does the trick.
```

```jsx file="./codeblocks/react/10_calculateTotal.tsx"

# Solving the same problem with React-RxJS

<NotesCodeSurfer>

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/1
The starting point is the same as before.

And the first thing that we 
did was to put the currencies
in context.
```

```jsx 86:97 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/01_startingpoint.tsx"
```

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/2
With React-RxJS we can use
bind for accomplishing the
same thing.

`bind` is the core of React-RxJS.
This is how it works:
- We pass an observalbe to it
- And optionally an initial value,
this initial value will only
be used if the observable
hasn't emitted anything yet.

and it returns a tuple with:
- A react-hook and
- The underlying observable that
the hook is going to use. This,
observable is multicasted and
it replays the latest emitted value.
It's very similar to `shareReplay(1)`,
but it doesn't create memory-leaks,
because when all it's subscribers
unsubscribe from it, it clears
its state and it unsubscribes from
its source.

Using `bind` here could look like
an overkill, but it has 2 advantages
over using context:
- It's a lot easier to setup.
- If in the future the currencies
is a dynamic value, we can just
replace `EMPTY` with the stream
of currencies without changing
anything else.
```

```jsx 13 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/02_1useCurrencies.tsx"
```

```diff 28
```

```jsx 28 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/02_2useCurrencies.tsx"
```

```diff 42
```

```notes
Now let's wire up the Exchange Rates
```

```jsx 42 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/02_3useCurrencies.tsx"
```

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/3
What's going on here?

The first line that's highlited uses
the util `createKeyedSignal` to create
a "signal" for each currency.

What this does is like creating
a subject per each currency, while
also separating the Observable and
the Observer.

In other words: `onRateChange` is
a void function that receives 2
arguments: a currency, which is
the key, and a number: which is
the payload.

We can use this function to
emit values through the observalbe.

- `rateChange$`, on the other hand,
is a function that receives the
currency as an argument and it returns
the observable of numbers for that
currency.

The nice thing about bind is that
we can also use it with with what
we call parametric observables,
like `rageChange$`.

Let's put this to use.
```

```jsx 15:19 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/03_1exchangeCurrencies.tsx"
```

```notes
Let's replace rate with our hook
and add pass the `onRateChange`
handler to the `onChange` of `NumberInput`
```

```diff 21:31
```

```notes
Let's make sure that this works.

It does! Also notice how the only
rows that are re-rendering are the
ones that are being updated.

Now, let's wire up the Orders:
```

```jsx 23,30:32 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/03_2exchangeCurrencies.tsx"
```

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/4
First we create a hook for accessing
the ids of the orders. We use the same
trick that we used for wiring up the
currencies, so that when the orders
start changing, we can just replace
the EMPTY stream with the Observable
of orderIds.

Next we create a keyed signal
for the priceChange and another one
for the currencyChange.

and finally we use bind for creating
the observable of each order.

I love the fact that on RxJS 7 we can
pass Objects of streams to `combineLatest`.

Notice that this time we are not
using a default value with `bind`. The
main implication of not passing the default
value to bind is that we have to make
sure that we are subscribed to the
underlying observable before render.

You will see what that means in just a sec.
```

```jsx 22:36 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/04_1orderLinePriceCurrency.tsx"
```

```notes
Let's wired up the Orders component.
```

```diff 102:111
```

```notes
We grab the ids from the `useOrderIds`
and now we only pass the id to the OrderLine
component.

Also, we are using `Subscribe` to ensure
that the subscription to the underlying 
stream exists before the Orderline component
renders.

This is only necessary b/c the
`useOrder` hook was created with a bind
that didn't have a default value.

Later we will see that there is a more
convenient way of accomplishing the same.
```

```jsx 103,107:109 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/04_2orderLinePriceCurrency.tsx"
```

```notes
moving on into the Orderline component...
```

```diff 87:100
```

```notes
First notice how now it only receives
the id, and then we use the `useOrder`
hook to access the order with this id.

We are also plugging the onPriceChange
and the onCurrencyChange, that's it.

Let's make sure that this works...

Nice!

Time to wire up the baseCurrencyPrice...
```

```jsx 87,88,95:97,103:105 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/04_3orderLinePriceCurrency.tsx"
```

```notes
Notice how the order$ stream is fact the
combination of the price and the currency
stream...

So, we could also create a rate$ stream
for theselected currency, and then combine
it with the that the price stream to obtain
a baseCurrencyPrice stream.

So, let's do that.
```

```diff 28:36
```

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/5
First we define the rate$ stream,
which listens to the currency$ stream
and every time that it emits it's going
going to switchMap to the currencyRate$
stream of this currency.

Keep in mind that the streams returned
by bind are replayable.

Now we can combine the rate with the
price stream, so that whenever one 
of them emits the baseCurrencyPrice
gets recomputed.

Now let's use this stream to add the
new baseCurrencyPrice property to the order.

That's it, now let's use it.
```

```jsx 18,34:37,42 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/05_1orderLineBaseCurrency.tsx"
```

```notes
we replace the hardcoded value with
the new property and done!
```

```diff 116
```

```notes
and we are done. let's try it out!

Notice that we never get re-renders
for unrelated things.

If we change the price of a currency
that's not being used, nothing else
get's re-rendered.
