# React-RxJS

Bringing Reactivity to React

---

## What this talk is about

<Notes>

Hi! first off, thanks a lot for having me at RxJS Live!

Since the name of this conference is RxJS live! I guess that I don't have to
convince you about the benefits of using Observables and RxJS, right?

Also, even if this is not a React conference, I'm going to assume that most of
you are somewhat familiar with React. For those of you who are not familiar with
React, I have to warn you: this talk it's going to be a little bit difficult to
follow, but there are some parts that you may find interesting anyways.

For those of you who have experience with React: have you ever wished that
you could use RxJS Observables for managing the domain state of your
applications?

Not as a means to aid a deficient state management library, like
we often do, but as a fully featured tool for managing our domain state?

Well I certainly did, and in this presentation I will be explaining why
thanks to React-RxJs we will be able to use RxJS as a very powerul state
management library.

In this talk I will be highlighting 3 benefits of using React-RxJS:

- The first one is that it allows us to derive our state using streams, which as
we will see, it's something that has a lot of benefits: one of them is that
we won't have to worry about triggering undesired React re-renders.

- The second one is that these bindings fully leaverage React Suspense, both
for data-loading and for code-splitting... and how thanks to this can greatly
improve the loading times of our React Applications.

- And the third benefit is that using streams for handling domain state produces
code that it's much easier to navigate, therefore making our solutions easier
to maintain.

## Let's build a demo application

<Notes>

Ok, let's get started! First we will build a demo Application.
The purpose of which is to highlight why
-for certain applications- using React as a state management library is less
than ideal, and why for those kinds of applications React-RxJS can be
a powerful tool for improving the maintaintanability and the performance of 
our React applications.

I've borrowed the "demo app" from Michel Westrate's
talk: "Mobx, or going from mutable to immutable to Reactive state management.".
In his talk Michel solves the same problem using different implemementations
and then he compares the tradeoffs of each solution.

We will do something similar, we
will first solve the problem using React -and our implementation is going to
be quite different from his implementations- and then we will solve the same 
problem using React-RxJS.

## Orders and Exchange rates: our demo application

<Notes>
This is the demo app that we will be building.

This application has:
- a section with orderlines and
- a section with exchange-rates that apply to them

The user can edit the price and the currency of each order, and when
they do the base-currency-price gets updated accordingly.

The only tricky thing about this, is that the base-currency-price
depends on the currency-rate of the selected currency.

Meaning that the values of the exchange rates affect the values of the orders.

The demo App an Add button, that it's going to add a random order when we press
it and a field with the sum of the base-currency-prices.

</Notes>

```notes checkout:react-local-state/1
Before we start coding, let's get familiar
with the starting point. Our awesome product
designer has set this up for us, it's a
bunch of presentation components without any
state, and our work is to bring this to life.

- The Orders component
- And the Currencies

and then, here in the middle: we have a
button for adding orders and these OrderTotal
component which renders the total sum of the
base-currency-price of the orders.

Perfect! Now, let's have a quick look at
the Orders and the Currencies
```

```jsx 86:97 file="./codeblocks/react/01_startingpoint.tsx"
App;
```

```notes
The Orders component is just a Table that
renders the different Orders, using the
OrdersLine Component.

Also, we notice that the initial orders are
currently hardcoded and they com from the
initialOrders which is imported from the utils
file.
```

```diff 70:78
  Orders
```

```notes
The Orderline component: very straightforward.
It gets an Order through props and it renders
its properties.
Its worth noting, though, that
the base-cc-price, which is a computed field,
is currenctly hardcoded.
```

```diff 55:68
  Orderline
```

```notes
The Currencies Component is almost identical
to the Orders component: just a table with
different columns and it renders a CurrencyRate
row for each currency.

Like with the orders, the currencies are
currently being hardcoded from the
`initialCurrencyRates` also come from the
utils file.
```

```diff 23:32
  Currencies
```

```notes
The CurrencyRate component: this is the one 
that it's used for editting the currencies
and it's also very straightforward:

It renders a currency, and it's rate value,
which can be editted through the NumberInput
component.

Awesome! Now let's start coding!
```

```diff 11:21
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/2
We have noticed that the currencies are
being used in the 2 main components. So,
this is data that needs to be accessed by
different components at different levels,
let's put use React Context to have them
easily available.

We create a hook to easily access the
currencies, and a CurrenciesProvider that
we will use in our root component.
```

```jsx 12:23 file="./codeblocks/react/02_1currencyContext.tsx"
```

```notes
Let's use the `useCurrencies` hook.
```

```diff 37:46
```

```jsx 37:46 file="./codeblocks/react/02_2currencyContext.tsx"
```

```notes
Again...
```

```diff 48:67
```

```jsx 48:67 file="./codeblocks/react/02_3currencyContext.tsx"
```

```notes
And let's use the CurrenciesProvider
in our root component.

Ok, that wasn't too hard!
```

```diff 100:111
```

```jsx 101,112 file="./codeblocks/react/02_4currencyContext.tsx"
```

```notes
Now lets wire up the
Exchanges Rate section
```

```diff 25:35
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/3
Easy! Let's keep it simple,
using `useState` should do.

I mean, we shouldn't be lifting
state unless we have to, right?

Look at that! This is working just great,
and without any annoying re-renders
on the components that are not concerned
with the currency that we just updated.

Now  that we are done with
the Exchanges Rate section
let's move on to the Orders
section.
```

```jsx 26,31 file="./codeblocks/react/03_exchangeRate.tsx"
```

```notes
Let's start by wiring up the price
and currency selection of each
order.
```

```diff 69:82
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/4
And again, a couple of `useState`
here and that's it!

Now let's make sure that this is
working correctly...

Amazing! Look at that: we got ~75% of
the functionality working already.

Ok, now let's wire up the
base-currency-price...

Oh, wait! shut! Mmmm... To calculate
this value we have to access the rate
of the selected currency.

All right, that's ok, we just need to lift
the state of the currency-rates, right?
No big deal... Let's do it.
```

```jsx file="./codeblocks/react/04_orderLinePrice.tsx"
```

```notes
We create another Context for the
currencyRates.
```

```diff 12:23
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/5
then we create a useCurencyRates hook
to easily access the state of the
currencyRates and a ContextProvider
that we can place in the already
existing Currencies Provider.
```

```jsx 19:23,26,29,31 file="./codeblocks/react/05_1liftCurrencyRates.tsx"
```

```notes
then we replace the useState with
our `useCurrencyRatesHook` and...
we are done!

Lifting state it's a bit of a pain,
but it's not so bad, right?

Ok, let's make sure that the
currency rates are still working...

Ok, so, they do work, but wait...
Oh, cmon, now every single row re-renders?

Oh, of course, because now every time
that a currency-rate changes the whole
record changes and that triggers
a re-render per each row... Dang!

Ok, there are a number of ways
that we can use to prevent these
re-renders... But I guess that the
simplest in this case is to let
the parent component pass
everything down to the CurrencyRate
component and then use the memo
HOC to prevent the CurrencyRate
component from re-rendering.

All right, all right, let's do
that...
```

```diff 36:46
```

```jsx 37:38,45:47 file="./codeblocks/react/05_2liftCurrencyRates.tsx"
```

```diff 36:63
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/7
Now the Currencies component
is the one passing down everything
that the CurrencyRate component
needs, and then we ehance
the CurrencyRate component
with `memo` to prevent
re-renders
```

```jsx 36:40,57,60:66 file="./codeblocks/react/06_avoidRerenders.tsx"
```

```notes
We are finally ready
to wire-up the base-ccy-price.
```

```diff 93:108
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/8
We obtain the currencyRates
from context and then we
can calculate the baseCurrencyPrice
using the getBaseCurrencyPrice
function that's defined in
the utils file.

Let's try it:

Nice, it's working...

Although every time that
we change a currency rate
every single order
re-renders, even when
we change a currency rate
that's not being used...

Of course, because we
are accessing the currencyRates
from the Orderline component
and now every time that
one of the currencies
changes that triggers
a re-render in every
Order...

We could prevent that
if the Orderline Component
received through props
the rate that its relevant
to them. However, in order
to know that, we need to
be able to access from
the outside the selected
currency... So, we should
also lift the state of
the selected currency.

Actually, we will have
to do that anyways, because
I just noticed that we will
need to access the state
of the base-ccy-price from
the outside to compute
the sum...

So, let's lift this state.
```

```jsx 97:98,108 file="./codeblocks/react/07_orderLinePrice.tsx"
```

```notes
Let's add a new context for
the orders, but before we
do that, we will first
create a reducer for
the Orders, because now
it's state is a bit more
complex than just setting
a property. Also, this
will help us to prevent
re-renders, because we
will be able to pass
the `dispatch` down
without createing new
functions.
```

```diff 15:55
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/9
The reducer is a bit
verbose, but it makes
things easier for the
consumer of dispatch.
```

```jsx 44:80 file="./codeblocks/react/08_1liftOrdersState.tsx"
```

```notes
Now we can create the context
for the orders... As usual
we create a hook for accessing
the orders from context
and a Provider that
we will place in our
root component.
```

```jsx 82:93 file="./codeblocks/react/08_2liftOrdersState.tsx"
```

```notes
Now lets change the Orders
component so that it
accesses the currencies
and the orders from
context and it spoon-feeds
the Orderline Component
```

```diff 171:180
```

```notes
That's it...
```

```jsx 172:173,177:182 file="./codeblocks/react/08_3liftOrdersState.tsx"
```

```notes
And time to make the
Orderline component a lot
dummer.
```

```diff 152:169
```

```notes
Now the Orderline component
receives everythng from props
and the onChange handlers
are a bit more verbose than
before, but that's ok.
```

```jsx 152:156,164:166,172:174 file="./codeblocks/react/08_4liftOrdersState.tsx"
```

```notes
And let's not forget to add
the OrdersProvider
```

```diff 204:217
```

```notes
Alright, now that we've
lifted the state, let's
make sure that we don't have
unwanted re-renders.

Nice!

Now we are finally ready
to make the Add button and
the OrderTotal component
work.
```

```jsx 206,217 file="./codeblocks/react/08_5liftOrdersState.tsx"
```

```notes
Let's start with the Add
button. Ok, so we better
create a component for this
button... Otherwise we
will be triggering re-renders
everywhere every time that
one of the orders change...

I guess that we could have
split the context of the orders
to separate the dispatch from
the state... Maybe next time!
```

```diff 211
```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/10
So, here we have the new
component accessing the
dispatch for creating a new row.

Let's see if it works...

Awesome!
```

```jsx 201:212,226 file="./codeblocks/react/09_addOrderButton.tsx"

```

```notes checkout:react-local-state/11
Almost done! Let's wire
this one up, and that's it...
```

```diff 214:217
```

```notes
So, we access the orders
and the currencyRates and
we map each order to calculate
its base-ccy-price and then
we add them all together
and we are done!

It bothers me a bit that
I have to recalculate the
base-ccy-price per each
order, because we have already
done this in the Orderline
component...

But, how else are we going
to do this using React as
a state-management library?

Create a common reducer
between the currencies and
the orders? So that we can
update the base-ccy-price
every time that one of
them change? That would
be pretty bad...

Should we use a library
like reselect for memoizing
these computations? That
wouldn't work either
because each Order
is a different computation.

Anyways, this does the trick.
```

```jsx file="./codeblocks/react/10_calculateTotal.tsx"

```

```diff 24:95
```

<Notes>
So, I don't know you, but I find this way of managing state super tedious:

Every time that we have to lift the state we have to:

- start worring about avoiding re-renders
- also, we don't have an easy way to define derive state, so we endup putting
  business logic inside the components
- Even after having applied all the recomended performance optimizations, we
  still see components that are being recomputed for state changes that don't
  affect them.

But why?

I think that this happens because we are conflating the view tree with the
state graph.

What does that even mean, right?

Well, if we had to draw a diagram that represents how our components are being
composed, that diagram would look more or less like this:

Let's call this the "view tree". Here at the top we have...

However, if we had to draw a diagram that represents how we would like to
compose the state, then that diagram would look more or less like this:

## View tree vs State Graph

<Notes>
Basically, we are defining each piece of state, like if we were defining the
cells of a spreadsheet:

For instnace, the orders total depends on the base ccy price of each order,
any time that one of the ccy prices updates the orders total will be recomputed.
And if they don't update, then it won't...

Similarly, the base-ccy-price of each order depends on the order the price that
the user has set for that order, and the currency rate of the selected currency,
so if the user selects the US Dollar, then it will depend on the currency rate
of the US dollar, and if the user selects the CAD Dollar it will depend on the
currency rate of the canadian dollar... And so on so forth...

So, if every time that we define a piece of state we define it based on its
dependencies, then we will be creating an loosely coupled solution, but not only
that, we will also make sure that we only recompute the parts of the state that
have to be recomputed.

However, if we use React as our state management library, we won't be able to
define our state like this, because react treats our state as a black box, it
doesn't understand its hierarchy or its relations... What's even worse is that
we will be using a tree for modeling graph, and that might be ok if the state
graph of our app completely overlaps with the view-tree, but if it doesn't,
then I don't think that we should be using React as our state management
library.

I would much rather to use React for modeling the view tree and then outiside of
react use a state management library that allows us to define our state based on
their dependencies... In other words: a reactive state managemnt library.

Something more or less like this.

<Notes>
However, if every time that we define a dynamic value we make that definition
based on how it relates to other dynamic values, then we will be building a
reactive and loosely coupled solution. Because our entities are only aware of
those entities that the depend upon for calculating ther next state, however
they don't know anything about the entities that are using them.

Wouldn't be great if we had a tool that allowed us to define our domain state
like this? Sure, right?

However, if those reactive pieces of state live outsid of React, how are we
going to consume them from our React components?

Well, that's why React-RxJS was created: to help us model our state based
on its actual relations, and then using react-hooks to easily consume
the state-entities inside our React components.

## Solving the same problem with React-RxJS

---

<NotesCodeSurfer>

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/1
The starting point is the same as before.

And the first thing that we 
did was to put the currencies
in context, right?
```

```jsx 86:97 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/01_startingpoint.tsx"
```

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/2
With React-RxJS we can use
bind for accomplishing the
same thing.

Bind is the secrete sauce of
React-RxJS. So, let me explain
what bind does:

Bind is a function that takes
at least one argument:

- The observable that will be emitting
the values that we want to use inside
react.

- The second argument, which is optional,
it's the default value that will
be used until the observable emits.

Then bind returns a tuple with 2
different things:

- A react-hook
- A shared and replayable version
of the input observable. In other
words, the improved version of the
input observable so that we can
keep deriving state from it.

Using `bind` here may look like
an overkill, but it has 2 advantages
over using react-context:

1) It's a less boilerplate.
2) If in the future the currencies
is become a dynamic value, we can
replace the `EMPTY` stream with a
stream of active currencies.
```

```jsx 13 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/02_1useCurrencies.tsx"
```

```notes
Ok, so let's use the useCurrencies hook.
```

```diff 28
```

```jsx 28 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/02_2useCurrencies.tsx"
```

```notes
Same...
``

```diff 42
```

```notes
Now let's wire up the Exchange Rates
```

```jsx 42 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/02_3useCurrencies.tsx"
```

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/3
What's going on here?

The first line that's highlited uses
the util `createKeyedSignal` to create
a "signal" for each currency.

In the context of React-RxJS we use
the term signal for refering to external
events.

Every time that we create a signal,
we want to have an observable for listening
to those events, and an event emitter
for emitting events.

Sometimes, though, we want to partition
the signals, so that each instance has
their own signal. That's what `createKeyedSignal`
does:

it returns a function for accessing
the observable of each instance, and an
event emitter where the first argument
is going to be the key of each instance
and the second argument is going to be
the value of the observable.

Using RxJS terminology is like creating
a subject per each currency, while
also separating the Observable and
the Observer.

It sound a lot more complicated than
it actually is.

In this case `onRateChange` is
an event emitter that receives 2
arguments: the currency (which is the key),
and the number, which is the payload.

Then `rateChange$`, is a function that
receives the currency as an argument
and it returns an observable of numbers
for that currency.

The nice thing about bind is that
we can also use it with with
functions that return observables
like `rageChange$`.

Let's wire this up...
```

```jsx 15:19 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/03_1exchangeCurrencies.tsx"
```

```notes
Now let's replace rate with our hook
and plug the `onRateChange` event-emitter
into the `onChange` of `NumberInput`
```

```diff 21:31
```

```notes
Let's make sure that this works.

It does! Also notice how the only
rows that are re-rendering are the
ones that are being updated.

Now, let's wire up the Orders:
```

```jsx 23,30:32 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/03_2exchangeCurrencies.tsx"
```

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/4
First we create a hook for accessing
the ids of the orders.

We are using the same trick that we
used for wiring up the currencies.

Then latter, when we implement
the functionality for adding orders,
we will replace this EMPTY stream
with on observable of orderIds.

Next we create a keyed signal
for the priceChange and another one
for the currencyChange.

and finally we use bind for creating
the observable of each order.

I love the fact that on RxJS 7 we can
pass Objects of streams to `combineLatest`!

Notice that this time we are not
using a default value with `bind`. The
main implication of not passing the default
value to bind is that we have to make
sure that we are subscribed to the
underlying observable before render.

There are many different ways of accomplishing
that, as we will see in just a moment.
```

```jsx 22:23 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/04_1orderLinePriceCurrency.tsx"
```

```diff 89:98
```

```jsx 90,93:95 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/04_2orderLinePriceCurrency.tsx"
```

```diff 22:23
```

```jsx 25:36 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/04_3_0orderLinePriceCurrency.tsx"
```

```notes
We grab the ids from the `useOrderIds`
and now we only pass the id to the OrderLine
component.

Also, we are using `Subscribe` to ensure
that the subscription to the underlying 
stream exists before the Orderline component
renders.

Remember, this is only necessary b/c the
`useOrder` hook was created with a bind
that didn't have a default value.

Later we will see that there is a more
convenient way of accomplishing the same.
```

```diff 87:100
```

```notes
First notice how now it only receives
the id, and then we use the `useOrder`
hook to access the order with this id.

We are also plugging the onPriceChange
and the onCurrencyChange, that's it.

Let's make sure that this works...

Nice!

Time to wire up the baseCurrencyPrice...
```

```jsx 89,90,97:99,105:107 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/04_3orderLinePriceCurrency.tsx"
```

```notes
Notice how the order$ stream is fact the
combination of the price and the currency
stream...

So, we could also create a rate$ stream
for theselected currency, and then combine
it with the that the price stream to obtain
a baseCurrencyPrice stream.

So, let's do that.
```

```diff 28:36
```

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/5
First we define the rate$ stream,
which listens to the currency$ stream
and every time that it emits it's going
going to switchMap to the currencyRate$
stream of this currency.

Keep in mind that the streams returned
by bind are replayable.

Now we can combine the rate with the
price stream, so that whenever one 
of them emits the baseCurrencyPrice
gets recomputed.

Now let's use this stream to add the
new baseCurrencyPrice property to the order.

That's it, now let's use it.
```

```jsx 18,34:37,42 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/05_1orderLineBaseCurrency.tsx"
```

```notes
we replace the hardcoded value with
the new property and done!
```

```diff 118
```

```notes
let's try it out!

Notice that it never get re-renders
for unrelated things.

If we change the price of a currency
that's not being used, nothing else
get's re-rendered.
```

```jsx 118 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/05_2orderLineBaseCurrency.tsx"
```

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/6
Now let's make sure that we can add new
orders.

Remember how we said that we would be
using an EMPTY stream until we implemented
this functionality?

Well, now let's replace that stream
with a stream that emits a list
with a new ID every time that the
user clicks the add button.
```

```diff 24
```

```notes
For doing that we will create a signal.
Not a keyed-signal, but a signal.

This is really just a way of separating
the Observable from the observer of the
underlying Subject.

And then every time that the addOrder$
stream emits, we map that to a new ID
and the we scan it to add that ID
to the latest list of ids.

Also, we need to make sure that the
initialOrder that's defined insde
the order$ stream, gets a random-order
if the id is not one of the initial ones.
```

```jsx 25:33,39 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/06_1addOrder.tsx"
```

```notes
Now lets wire up the button with the
onAddOrder emitter that we got when
we created the signal and that's it.
```

```diff 153
```

```notes
notice that this time we don't have
to create a new component for the AddButton.

Let's make sure that this works...
```

```jsx 153 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/06_2addOrder.tsx"
```

```notes
The last thing that we have to do
wire up is the total-base-ccy-price.

We need to take every base-currency-price
from each order and add it.

In other words, we new to somehow
combine the stream of orderIds
with each stream of orders.

React-RxJS/utils provides a handy
helper for that named `combineKeys`
```

```diff 27,51
```

```notes checkout:react-rxjs/7
`combineKeys` takes a stream of ids as
the first argument, and a factory of
streams as the second argument and returns
a stream that emmits a Map of values
every time that one of the values of the Map
changes, or any time that entries of the
map changes.

So, we combine the stream of orderIds$
with the stream of baseCurrencyPrices,
and then we add those values together.

Let's finish this...
```

```jsx 27,55:59 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/07_1Total.tsx"
```

```notes
Here let's use the `useTotal` hook.
```

```diff 147:150
```

```jsx 153 file="./codeblocks/react-rxjs/07_2Total.tsx"
```

```notes
Now, at this point, perhaps you're
thinking sure, but this is a contrived
example... does this actually scale
in a real application?

Well, I'm glad you asked! Let me
present to you Reactive Trader!

The super cool open source showcase trading platform that we have built at
Adaptive.

This is Reactive Trader!

The code of it is fully available on Github under the AdaptiveConsulting
organization and the name of the repo is ReactiveTraderCloud.

Reactive-Trader is a key project for us, for 2 different reasons:

- The first one is that most of our clients are financial institutions that don't
want for their competitors to know that we are doing work for them.
That's why it's important for us to have showcase applications, so that we can
demo to our potential clients what we are capable of.

- The second reason is that at Adaptive we foster innovation and Reactive Trader
is a tool that allows us to experiment better ways of doing things and share that
knowledge, not only inside the company, but also externaly.

So this is RT, now I'm not going to explain everything that happens here, b/c
it's quite complex, but you get the idea, right? There are lots of different
moving pieces... prices that are being received from a push based API based
on web sockets, etc.

Now, Reactive Trader is a project that got started many years ago and it has
gone through different refactors... The latest one started a few monnths
ago when we decided to fully rearchitect it by leaveraging React-RxJS.

So, in the previous section we saw how thanks to React-RxJS we can improve the
performance of our React applications by not over-stressing react with
unnecessary re-renders... However, when it comes to web-performance, the most
important metrics are those ones that have to do with loading times and probably
Lighthouse is the best tool for analying those metrics.

So, will React-RxJS help us at improving the loading times of our React Apps?

Well, in the case of RT we have been able to improve its lighthouse score from
a score of 43 to a score of 96.

What it's most impressive, in my opinion, is how we've been able to improve the
unused amount of javascript that was penalizing us with two point 26 seconds
on loading times.

It would be unfair to say that this is only thanks to react-rxjs, b/c there are
other things that we've done better, this time... But one thing that react-rxjs
has done for us is that it has allowed us to optimally code-split our App,
without having to make any compromises on the way that we coded the App.

But before I show you how we did that, allow me to first explain how
code-splitting works, for those of you how are not very familiar with this
concept:

## Code Splitting

---

<Notes>
This is what happens when we try to load a web page: the browser will make
a GET request and the server returns an HTML file.

In this example, it takes 130ms from the moment that the client makes the
request, until the moment that it receives the first bytes of data, then it
takes about 5ms to receive the HTML content and about 10 ms to parse the HTML
data... At that point the browser will start a series of requests with the
resources that the HTML file has declared: css files, fonts, images, etc.

One of those requests is going to be the main js asset of our web-application.

So, if we don't do any sort of code-splitting our main js asset will take
about 1 second to be fully downloaded and uncompressed, but once it has been
downloaded and uncompressed, it will still take another 1.4 seconds to be
fully parsed, compiled and evaluated.

But something that's really important is the fact that all this
parsing/compiling and evaluation must happen on the main process, meaning that
this blue block represetns a blocking task.

Side-note here: that's why we should always take into account the parsing size
of our JS assets, rather than looking at the compressed sizes.

Once the main JS asset has been evaluated, then the browser will start
requesting the data that's being used inside our 3 main components that we have
seen before.

So if we don't do any sort of code-splitting, then will be able to have a fully
functional application after all these requests have finished.

The problem here is that if we don't do any sort of code-splitting we will
be shipping all this unused code that's not necessary for the initial render.
Which is unfortunate, because that unused code is delaying the API requests
and taking a significant amount of blocking time when the app gets initially
loaded.

So, it would be ideal if we moved all that code that's unsued on the first
render outside of the main chunk, right?

</Notes>

<Notes>
So an improvement, and this is what most ppl do, is to code-split the JS assets
like this: we create different chunks for the different parts of the application
that depend on data that will arrive at a later stage, and whenever that chunk
gets downloaded/parsed/compiled and evaluated then we start the request for the
data that the chunk needs.

Now, the issue with this is that if we want to have all the logic for the
LiveRates self-contained on its chunk, then it's difficult to start the request
for the data that the chunk needs before the chunk gets loaded. However, this
creates this waterfall effect: ideally we would like to start the data requests
as soon as the main chunk gets parsed...

And BTW, this is assuming that we have been able to actually move all the logic
of sections on their corresponding chunk, and I'm saying this because what it
tends to happen when we use state-management libraries that are based on central
stores, or when we use react as a state management library but we lift too much
state is this:

That the main chunk is a lot bigger because a lot of the logic that is related
with each of those components got pulled into the main assed: maybe because
we are relying on a root reducer, or on a root saga, or on a root context, etc.

And even then it's difficult to get those requests started before the chunk
gets loaded.

So, this is a lot better, right? If we use a state management library that
allows us to encapsulate all the logic for each one of these components on
their corresponding chunk.

But still, we are facing this whatefall problem, because ideally we would like
to code-split our app like this:

<Notes>
This is what we want to do. We want to make sure that we start the data-requests
as soon as the main chunk loads, in parallel with the requests for those JS
assets.

And in a super-ideal world, we would like to be able to do this:

preload the async chunks by referencing them in the HTML file with the
"modulepreload" link, so that we start all the requests as soon as possible.

This is the kind of code-splitting that we have been able to implement thanks
to the fact that we are using react-rxjs.

So let's see how we did that.
